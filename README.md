# nextjs-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Senior-Caucus/nextjs-app.git
cd nextjs-app
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, follow these steps to install them:

### Install Node.js and npm
1. Download the Node.js installer from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer, following the prompts to complete the installation. This will also install npm.

Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

Then, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start by looking at `src/app/page.tsx` for the instructions. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
